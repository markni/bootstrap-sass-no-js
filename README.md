# Bootstrap for Sass (Without Js)

Not everyone needs Jquery and Javascript for their bootstrap projects. So I made a fork.

Also come with a grunt file to build from scss to css.


## Install

	bower bootstrap-sass-no-js

## Build

If you modified the SASS file, you will want to rebuild the css:

	npm install
	grunt
