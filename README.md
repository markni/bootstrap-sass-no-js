# Bootstrap for Sass (Without Js)

Not everyone needs Jquery and Javascript for their bootstrap projects. 

This fork is modified from the offical repo to suit such a need.  

Primiarly aim to be an alternative choice of `sass-bootstrap` bower package which included in many Yeoman generators for JS developers.  

Included a minimal Grunt file to build from scss to css. 


The original ruby files are not modifed, but not tested. 


## Install

	bower install bootstrap-sass-no-js

## Build

If you modified the SASS file, you will want to rebuild the css:

	npm install
	grunt
